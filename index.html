            Cayman Brac a Nature Lover’s paradise is 12 miles long and 1 mile wide and has the most dramatic topography
            of the three Cayman Islands. Its majestic Bluff rises west to east along the island’s length to 152 feet
            above Spot Bay.
            Many mysterious caves are carved throughout this awe-inspiring natural attraction. The land and seascape
            offer
            visitors an ideal environment for outdoor activities such as hiking, rock climbing, birding, caving,
            cycling, fishing
            and scuba diving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Home to some of the best dive sites in the world. The Bluff provides a natural barrier between the North
            Side and the open sea, making calm, clear waters ideal for diving and snorkelling. Dramatic drop-offs,
            swim-throughs and
            caves make it a mecca for divers of all levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fishing is also excellent both from the shore and by boat. The deep-sea angler can test his skills against a
            blue marlin, tuna, wahoo, dolphin and barracuda. Reef fishing provides ample opportunity to catch grouper,
            snapper and other delicious fish.

              Growing up in the Cayman Islands has been a very humbling experience as each of us treats each other as
              family,including our friends from overseas hence the reason we have a high return rate of stay-over tourism. We go the extra

              <h1>The Bluff</h1>
              <p>
                The Bluff is a popular destination in Cayman Brac. The steep cliffs offer stunning views of the ocean
                and the nearby
                reefs. Visitors can also enjoy hiking, bird watching, and picnicking in the area. The Bluff stands 152
                feet above sea
                level and is the highest point on the island. The views from the top are truly breathtaking.

              <p>
                MV Captain Keith Tibbetts was a retired Cuban spy ship that was sunk as an artificial reef off the coast
                in 1996. The
                wreck is now a popular dive site and home to a variety of marine life. MV Captain Keith Tibbetts is a
                great example of
                how something that was once used for negative purposes can be transformed into something positive and
                beneficial for the
                environment.

              <h1>Parrot Preserve</h1>
              <p>
                This stunning Island is home to one of the Cayman's most unique and beloved residents – the Cayman Brac
                parrot.
                This vibrant little bird is found nowhere else in the world, and is an key part of Cayman’s natural
                heritage. The
                Cayman Brac parrot is endangered, but due to the efforts of dedicated conservationists, its population
                is slowly
                beginning to rebound. The Cayman Brac Parrot Reserve is a key part of this effort, providing a safe
                haven for these
                birds to thrive. Visitors to the Parrot Reserve can learn about the work being done to save these
                special birds, and
                even get up close and personal with them on guided tours.
